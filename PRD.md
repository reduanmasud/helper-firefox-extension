# Product Requirements Document: Firefox Console Script Manager Extension

## Overview
The Firefox Console Script Manager is a browser extension that allows users to create, manage, and execute JavaScript scripts directly in the browser console. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting DOM elements, capturing XPaths, defining variables, and running custom scripts on any webpage.

## Target Users
- Web developers
- QA engineers
- Web automation enthusiasts
- Data scrapers
- Web researchers

## Key Features

### 1. Script Management
- Create, edit, save, and delete JavaScript scripts
- Assign descriptive names to scripts for easy identification
- Organize scripts into categories or tags
- Import/export scripts for backup or sharing

### 2. Element Selection
- Visual element picker tool that highlights elements on hover
- Automatically generate XPath expressions for selected elements
- Copy XPath to clipboard
- Store selected elements as variables for use in scripts

### 3. Variable Management
- Create and manage multiple variables
- Support for different variable types (string, number, boolean, object)
- Use variables within scripts via template syntax
- Edit variable values before script execution

### 4. Script Execution
- Run scripts on any webpage with a single click
- View execution results in a dedicated panel
- Option to run scripts automatically when specific pages load
- Execution history with timestamps and results

### 5. User Interface
- Clean, intuitive popup interface
- Script editor with syntax highlighting
- Collapsible panels for scripts, variables, and execution results
- Responsive design that works well at different browser window sizes

## User Flows

### Creating a New Script
1. User clicks the extension icon to open the popup
2. User clicks "New Script" button
3. User enters a name for the script
4. User writes JavaScript code in the editor or uses the element selector
5. If using element selector:
   - User clicks "Select Element" button
   - Extension enters selection mode
   - User hovers over elements on the page and clicks to select
   - Extension captures the XPath and adds it to the script
6. User adds variables if needed
7. User saves the script

### Running a Script
1. User navigates to target webpage
2. User clicks the extension icon
3. User selects a saved script from the list
4. User clicks "Run" button
5. Extension executes the script in the page context
6. Results are displayed in the results panel

### Managing Variables
1. User opens the extension popup
2. User clicks "Variables" tab
3. User can add, edit, or delete variables
4. Variables can be referenced in scripts using a special syntax (e.g., `${variableName}`)

## Technical Requirements

### Extension Structure
- Popup HTML/CSS/JS for the user interface
- Background script for managing extension state
- Content scripts for interacting with webpage DOM
- Storage API for saving scripts and variables

### Browser Compatibility
- Firefox (primary target)
- Potential for Chrome/Edge compatibility in future versions

### Security Considerations
- Scripts run in isolated context to prevent access to extension internals
- Clear warnings about potential risks of running custom scripts
- No automatic script execution without user confirmation
- No collection of user script data

## MVP Features

### Phase 1 (Initial Release)
- Basic script editor with syntax highlighting
- Element selector with XPath generation
- Simple variable management (string type only)
- Script saving and execution
- Basic results display

### Phase 2
- Enhanced variable types
- Script categorization
- Import/export functionality
- Execution history

### Phase 3
- Scheduled script execution
- Advanced element selection options
- Script templates and sharing
- Performance optimizations

## Success Metrics
- Number of active users
- Frequency of script executions
- User retention rate
- User feedback and ratings
- Number of reported bugs

## Timeline
- Design and planning: 2 weeks
- Development of MVP (Phase 1): 4 weeks
- Testing and bug fixes: 2 weeks
- Initial release: End of week 8
- Phase 2 features: 4 weeks after initial release
- Phase 3 features: 8 weeks after Phase 2

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Browser API changes | High | Low | Monitor Firefox release notes, maintain compatibility testing |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Regular security audits, sandboxed execution environment |
| Poor performance on complex pages | Medium | Medium | Optimize code, provide performance settings |
| User confusion with complex features | Medium | High | Create clear documentation, tooltips, and tutorials |

## Future Considerations
- Chrome/Edge compatibility
- Cloud sync for scripts across devices
- Collaboration features for team environments
- Integration with developer tools
- AI-assisted script generation
- Support for running scripts across multiple tabs
